## Rubric - The basics

A rubric defines the way a [submission](/testing/submission) should be graded.
In the form of a table, a rubric may look something like this:

### Recursive Fibonacci rubric

|Criterion|Max points|Min points|
|---------|----------|----------|
|The method has javadoc|0|-1|
|The method is recursive|1|0|
|The method works for n = 0 and n = 1|1|0|
|The method works for n >= 0|1|0|

Every row in the above table represents a [criterion](criterion_overview), which may be applied to a
[submission](/testing/submission). This process is called grading and produces a [graded rubric](/graded/rubric) composed of
[graded criteria](/graded/criterion). The result may look something like this:

### Recursive Fibonacci graded rubric

|Criterion|Max points|Min points|Actual points|
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
|The method has javadoc|0|-1|0|
|The method is recursive|1|0|1|
|The method works for n = 0 and n = 1|1|0|1|
|The method works for n >= 0|1|0|1|
|**Total**|-|-|3|

## Writing a rubric

To get started writing a rubric, create a class that implements `RubricProvider` and annotate it with `@RubricForSubmission`

```java
import org.jagrkt.api.rubric.*;

@RubricForSubmission("H00")
public class H00_RubricProvider implements RubricProvider {
}
```

The next step is to create a very basic rubric. This may be done like this with the [rubric builder](rubric_builder).

```java
public static final Rubric RUBRIC = Rubric.builder()
  .title("My awesome rubric")
  .build();
```

Finally, create a `RUBRIC` field and implement `getRubric()`. The end result is:

```java
import org.jagrkt.api.rubric.*;

@RubricForSubmission("H00")
public class H00_RubricProvider implements RubricProvider {

  public static final Rubric RUBRIC = Rubric.builder()
    .title("My awesome rubric")
    .build();

  @Override
  public Rubric getRubric() {
    return RUBRIC;
  }
}
```

This will create an empty rubric for the assignment `H00`.
The next step is to add criteria to the rubric, head on over to [criterion overview](criterion_overview) for info.

  This guide demonstrates the recommended way of constructing a rubric provider. You may, of course, find it necessary to change
  the structure of your rubric provider to fit your project's needs. The only requirement is that you have a top-level public
  class implementing RubricProvider annotated with @RubricForSubmission that is instantiable without arguments.
